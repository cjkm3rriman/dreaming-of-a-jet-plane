# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a FastAPI application called "dreaming-of-a-jet-plane" that uses Yoto to help users learn about jet planes in the sky and their destinations. The project is deployed on Railway.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.13+**: Core language
- **UV**: Python package manager for dependency management
- **FastAPI**: Web framework with standard extras
- **Railway**: Deployment platform

## Development Commands

### Package Management
```bash
uv install          # Install dependencies
uv add <package>    # Add new dependency
uv remove <package> # Remove dependency
uv sync             # Sync environment with lock file
```

### Running the Application
```bash
uv run fastapi dev app/main.py    # Run development server
uv run fastapi run app/main.py    # Run production server
uv run fastapi run app/main.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000    # Run with custom host/port
```

### Railway Deployment
```bash
# Railway will automatically use the railway.toml configuration
# Or fall back to the Procfile for deployment
railway up    # Deploy to Railway (if Railway CLI is installed)
```

## Project Structure

```
app/
├── __init__.py     # Empty package initializer
└── main.py         # FastAPI application entry point
railway.toml        # Railway deployment configuration
Procfile           # Alternative deployment configuration
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Simple FastAPI Structure**: Single-file application in `app/main.py`
- **FastAPI App Instance**: Created directly in main.py (note: indentation suggests this may need fixing)
- **Basic Route**: Single root endpoint returning JSON message
- **UV Package Management**: Uses `pyproject.toml` for project configuration and `uv.lock` for dependency locking

The application currently has a basic structure with a single endpoint. The main FastAPI app is defined in `app/main.py:3` with a root GET endpoint at `app/main.py:5-7`.
